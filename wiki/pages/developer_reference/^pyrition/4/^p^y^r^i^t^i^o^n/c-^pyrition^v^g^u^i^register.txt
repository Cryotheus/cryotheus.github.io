# PyritionVGUIRegister
Called before vgui.Register, used to modify registered panels.
To modify a specific panel by class_name, make a hook with the event `PyritionVGUIRegister_Jeff` where `Jeff` is what the class_name is.
This version of the hook is called after PyritionVGUIRegister and is not called with the class_name parameter.
