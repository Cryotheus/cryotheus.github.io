# GlobalHookCreate
This creates a macro to hook.Call the key prefixed by Pyrition.
This is done automatically to all functions starting with Pyrition in the PYRITION table after all of Pyrition loads.
The function you call this for MUST be prefixed with Pyrition.
The key parameter should not contain the Pyrition prefix however.
Set post to true to create a hook prefixed PyritionPost which is called after hook's function is called.
