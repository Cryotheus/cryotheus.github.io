# VectorCompileBezier
Compiles a bezier method into the Vector metatable.
You only need to call this once, per point count.
The created method is named Bezier# where # is the point count specified.
```
--only call these once, anywhere before you need to use them.
PYRITION:VectorCompileBezier(3)
PYRITION:VectorCompileBezier(4)

--now you can use the newly created methods
Msg(Vector(1, 2, 3):Bezier3(0.75, Vector(4, 5, 6), Vector(7, 8, 9)))
Msg(Vector(1, 2, 3):Bezier4(0.75, Vector(4, 5, 6), Vector(7, 8, 9), Vector(10, 11, 12)))
```
