# What
Pyrition is an administration addon with a massive quantity of features for developers to take advantage of. It was created with the sole purpose of providing more control over permissions, but became much more than that after a total of 3 rewrites (2 more if you count the client side command systems Pyrition was).

# Why
A very long time ago, I (Cryotheum) ran into an issue with freezing permissions on players while they were in mini-games with an Expression 2 extension I was writing called Game Core. After several attempts of making compatibility with several different administration addons, I caved in and started creating my own administration addon.  
This did not stay the main motivation behind the development of Pyrition however. Around a year after development started, my friends' desire for a localized administration addon and my own desire to make a library addon became the main drive and motivation to continue development.

# Pyrition Today
Pyrition is not ready for public deployment and likely will not be until Q2 2024. Necrosis is planned to deploy alongside Pyrition as a dependency.
